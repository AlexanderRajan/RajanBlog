# 10. Motor system

## Overview

Overview of motor system (why motor is so closely tied with somatosensory, big picture)

## Muscles

All movement starts with muscles

### Muscle components

Muscle fibers

### Muscle types
There are two key characteristics of muscles: their structure (striated or smooth), and whether they can be voluntarily controlled. Based on these characteristics, there are three types of muscles in vertebrates (and humans).

|   | Striated | Smooth |
|---|---|---|
| **Voluntary** | Skeletal muscle |   |
| **Involuntary** | Cardiac muscle | Smooth muscle |

* Skeletal muscle

   These are what most people think of when they think “muscle.”
   AKA "voluntary muscle" because they are the muscles that move when you choose to make a movement. They are voluntarily contracted (and in reflexes) to move your body by moving your skeleton.  
   Skeletal muscles are composed of 
* Cardiac muscle

   Can be thought of as a hybrid between skeletal muscles and smooth muscles, in that they are structured like skeletal muscles (striated muscles) but not under conscious control. 
   
* Smooth muscle

   These are the muscles embedded within organs like your stomach and intestines, blood vessels, and baldder. 
   They are also known as "involuntary" muscles because they are not under direct conscious control. 
   
### Motor units
Groups of organized muscles


### Muscle functions
Muscles contract
    Leads to changes in shape - usually shortening, but sometimes not!
    Strength vs speed (form and function)

Muscles in opposition

Control of digestion, bladder, blood vessels, etc

What triggers the muscles? Neurons!
    
## Control of muscles - NMJ
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) on a cellular level
Stuff about muscles (stretching and depolarization of muscle cells)

## Reflexes  & spinal cord control 
(knee jerk reflex) and central pattern generators (mostly for walking, decerebrate cat prep)
Respiration
