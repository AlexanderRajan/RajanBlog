# 10. Motor system

## Overview

Overview of motor system (why motor is so closely tied with somatosensory, big picture)

## Muscles

All movement starts with muscles

### Muscle types
* Skeletal muscle
   These are what most people think of when they think “muscle.”
   AKA "voluntary muscle" because they are the muscles that move when you choose to make a movement. They are voluntarily contracted (and in reflexes) to move your body by moving your skeleton  
   
* Smooth muscle
   These are the muscles embedded within organs like your stomach and intestines, blood vessels, and baldder. 
   They are also known as "involuntary" muscles because they are not under direct conscious control. 
* Cardiac muscle
   Can be thought of as a hybrid between skeletal muscles and smooth muscles, in that they are structured like skeletal muscles but not under conscious control

### Muscle functions
Muscles contract
    Leads to changes in shape - usually shortening, but sometimes not!

Muscles in opposition

Control of digestion, bladder, blood vessels, etc

What triggers the muscles? Neurons!
    
## Control of muscles - NMJ
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) on a cellular level
Stuff about muscles (stretching and depolarization of muscle cells)

## Reflexes  & spinal cord control 
(knee jerk reflex) and central pattern generators (mostly for walking, decerebrate cat prep)
Respiration
