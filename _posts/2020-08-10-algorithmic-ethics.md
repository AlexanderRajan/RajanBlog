# Algorithmics Ethics

a lot of the ethical and philosophical arguments that are (often rightfully) critical of data science are often led by non-practicioners https://mathbabe.org/2013/03/07/poseurs-should-not-own-the-backlash-against-data-science-poseurs/ counter examples: http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/03/untangling-algorithmic-illusions-from-reality-in-big-data.html kate crawford

black female philosopher found from evgeny's syllabus who has been teacher herself to algorithms and to code

and thinking about how to make a more equitable data science: https://data-smart-schools.net/2019/04/21/thinking-against-data-science-os-keyes-2019/

seems to fail to lead to solutions

indeed a lot of problems of this sort don't seem to have clear solutions: how to roll back deployed systems (eg, drones patroling baltimore)

or regain protections and privacy once lost (social medial and the profiteering of online activity)

and the inability to regulate or legislate in advance of scientific and technological advances (facial recognition software used by law enforcement crispr designed babies)

that don't give large corporations monopolistic advantages, promotin small businesses and hacker mentality

other than better education access to scientific and statistical literacy
