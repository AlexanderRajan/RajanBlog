# 10. Motor system

## Overview

The motor system is how we control our body. It is involved in planning and executing movements, but also in pumping blood and digesting food. The two key roles of the motor system are to plan, control, and execute voluntary (deliberate) movements, and to control involuntary (subconscious or automatic) functions.

The motor system is often described as a top-down process: in a voluntary movement, neural activity in the frontal lobe sends commands down to motoneurons located in the brainstem or spinal cord, which in turn activate muscles. In reality, motor control is more of a loop, with sensory information about the current posture and contact with objects informing the motor plan, and the motor plan providing predictions about upcoming movement to the somatosensory system. Without knowing where you are, it's difficult to plan a route to your destination, and getting feedback along the way helps your brain know if it needs to adjust the plan. 

Accordingly, instead of thinking about motor control as top-down, it makes more sense to think of it as a loop or set of nested loops, where motor and sensory processes are closely intertwined. The main loop is the descending (from brain to muscle) motor command, and the ascending (from muscle to brain) sensory feedback, and examples of nested loops are reflexes and interactions between areas within the brain (eg, M1 & S1).

## Muscles

You can't move without muscles, so we'll start there!

As mentioned above, there are both voluntary and involuntary motor functions. Usually people think of deliberate movements and the voluntary skeletal muscles when thinking about the motor system. Here we'll describe skeletal muscle in the most detail, as they are the most studied, and provide information along the way about how cardiac and smooth muscle are different.

The main thing that muscles do is contract, and they tend to get wider as they get shorter. As you flex your arm starting from fully extended, your bicep changes from long and thin to short and thick. Different muscles have different characteristics driven by their shape and composition. For example, some muscles can be active for a long time without getting tired (maintaining your posture in your chair as you read this) while others can exert a lot of force but get tired quickly (lifting weights in the gym).

When people study muscles, some of the key measurements are where they connect to the bone, how long they are, how thick they are, and what type of muscle fibers they are made of. These measurements can be used to calculate how much force a muscle can generate and how quickly the joint can move.

### Muscle components - fasciles, fibers, and sarcomeres

Individual muscles, such as your biceps brachii, are made up of several muscle fascicles, which in turn are made up of muscle fibers. Muscle fibers are the individual cells in which contraction occurs. The functional units for contraction are called sarcomeres. Here's where smallest unit of movement happens! It is the aggregated activity of hundreds of thousands of sarcomeres within each muscle fiber that generates the force with which you walk your dog, chew your food, and even what beats your heart.

The smallest functional unit of muscles are sarcomeres. This diagram shows 3 sarcomeres in parallel, with the thin actin filaments in blue, and thick myosin filaments in red.
   
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Sarcomere.svg/450px-Sarcomere.svg.png" alt="Sarcomere diagram" width=400/>

The (contr)action within sarcomeres happens between actin and myosin. Actin are thin filaments that form the scaffolding, and myosin are thick filaments that pull the actin together, shortening the sarcomere and contracting the muscle. Although each sarcomere is small (1.5 to 3.5 µm), many are stacked back to back along the length of each fiber, pulling against each other to contract through the whole range of your joints. Many sarcomeres (and fibers and fasciles) bundled in parallel provide the combined force that give muscles strength. The strength in all of your muscles comes from these tiny threads pulling against each other.

Sarcomeres are visible under a microscipe:

### Muscle types
There are two key characteristics of muscles: their structure (striated or smooth), and whether they can be voluntarily controlled. Based on these characteristics, there are three types of muscles in vertebrates (and humans).

|   | Striated | Smooth |
|---|---|---|
| **Voluntary** | Skeletal muscle |   |
| **Involuntary** | Cardiac muscle | Smooth muscle |

* Skeletal muscle

   These are what most people think of when they think “muscle.” They attach to bones with tendons, and exert force on your skeleton to create movement and exert force on objects.
   
   <img src="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/images/anatomy/muscular/muscle_structure.jpg" alt="Bone, tendon, muscle" width=400/>
   Muscles are connected to your bones via tendons. While you can train and grow muscles with exercise, your tendons and bones pretty much stay the same. Make sure you don't overwork your tendons! They don't recover as quickly as muscle.
   
   Skeletal muscles are also called "voluntary muscles" because they are the muscles that move when you choose to make a movement. They are voluntarily contracted (and in reflexes) to move your body by moving your skeleton.  
   
   
   
   
   There are two types of skeletal muscles: fast twitch and slow twitch fibers. 
   
   * Fast twitch muscles generate a lot of force quickly, but also tire quickly. They are used mostly in high intensity exercise like lifting weights and sprinting.  
   * Slow twitch muscles generate less force, but can work for a long time. They are used in endurance exercise like jogging.
   (Many exercises use a mix of both).
   
   Muscles come in several different shapes, defined by the arrangement of their fibers and how they connect to tendons. The different shapes allow for different properties: some can change length quickly, others change shape less but are stronger. Another consideration for shape is the geometry of the joint they cover: for example, pectoralis muscle reaches from your chest across your shoulder, and so the muscle is wide and flat where it connects to your sternum, and narrows to a point where it connects to your upper arm.
   
   <img src="https://www.teachpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shapes-muscle595.jpg" alt="Shapes of skeletal muscles" width=400/>
   
   * Most striated muscles are parallel, where all of the cells that exert force work in the same direction. This leads to the largest change in length.
   * Some muscles are pennate, or feather shaped. These muscles can generate more force, but change length less and are slower. 
   * Hydrostats, unlike other skeletal muscles, move themselves instead of bones. Think of your tongue, or an elephant's trunk, which can grasp objects, push food around, and change shape to create different sounds during talking.
   

* Cardiac muscle

   Can be thought of as a hybrid between skeletal muscles and smooth muscles, in that they are structured like skeletal muscles (striated muscles) but not under conscious control. 
   
* Smooth muscle

   These are the muscles embedded within organs like your stomach and intestines, blood vessels, and baldder. 
   They are also known as "involuntary" muscles because they are not under direct conscious control. 

### Muscle functions

Muscles in cooperation and opposition

Agonists, synergists, fixators, and antagonists

The agonist is the main mover, like the biceps brachii when you flex your elbow. It's movement is supported by synergistic muscles, including the brachialis and brachioradialis. These can also be fixators, providing stability and preventing or allowing rotation of the wrist while flexing at the elbow. Antagonist muscles are those that move in the opposite direction to the agonist. For the elbow, this is the triceps bracii, which is how you extend your elbow. Another example of an agonist-antagonist pair are the hamstrings to flex the leg, and the gradriceps to extend it.

Muscles tend to be proximal to the joint that they move. Your pectoralis muscles are proximal to your shoulder, and your biceps brachii are prixmal to your elbow. When splinting a bone, you want to secure the joints on both sides of the bone; when splinting a joint, you want to secure the bones on both sides of the joint.

Dynamic stretching increases bloodflow to muscles and tendons and is a good way to prevent injuries by stretching before exercise. However, stretching can't prevent overuse injuries or damage to tendons. Passive stretching (after exercise) can be useful to decrease muscle soreness.

What triggers the muscles? Neurons!

### Motor units & motor pools
Groups of organized muscles
Motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates
Groups of motor unites work together to coordinate contractions within a single muscle
A motor pool is all of the individual neurons that innervate a single muscle

Motoneurons are the only neurons that innervate skeletal muscles. When and only when a motoneuron fires does a skeletal muscle contract.

## Reflexes  & spinal cord control 

Reflexes are involuntary and cannot be done volitionally (although they can be suppressed volitionally). Reflexes involve very simple circuits. Sensory information comes in from the periphery to motoneurons in the brainstem or spinal cord. The information comes in and goes out quickly so that reflexes can take as short as 1/100th of a second to happen.

The most common reflex, that you see all the time in movies and TV shows, is the patellar reflex, aka stretch or “knee-jerk” or myotatic reflex. [YOUTUBE] The doctor hits a tendon, which causes the muscle to stretch a small amount. Sensory receptors in the muscle detect this stretch, and send the signal to the spinal cord. This sensory neuron synapses directly onto a motoneuron, which then tells the thigh muscle to contract, making the kicking “knee-jerk” movement. This is called a “monosynaptic reflex arc,” because it only involves one central synapse between the sensory and motor neurons (arc here refers to the pathway the reflex information takes).
The stretch reflex detects an unexpected increase in muscle length, tells the quadriceps to contract which produces a movement that opposed the original muscle stretch.

## Motor Control in the Brain

All volitional (non-reflexive) movement begins in the brain. Even CPGs are started and stopped by signals from the brain.
The neurons in the brain involved are mostly found in the frontal cortex, and include primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and supplemental motor areas. Some cortical areas in the parietal lobe that are mostly somatosensory can also induce movement when stimulated. Motor and somatosensory areas are densely interconnected. Also, some motor areas have sensory responses! It's kind of a mess.

The mapping methods used to chart out the functions of sensory areas (eg, presenting flashes of light to the retina to explore activity in visual cortex, or sweeps of sound to for auditory cortex) are different for motor areas. What would you do to figure out what section of the body an area motor cortex maps to? If you were trying to find a "thumb representation" by wiggling someone's thumb, you would mostly activate somatosensory areas that are involved in proprioception like Areas 3a and 2 within primary somatosensory cortex. Instead, experimenters apply electrical impulses to parts of the brain, and see which muscles respond with twitches and movement! These were some of the first brain mapping experiments done, back in the late 19th century!

The first discovery was that electrically stimulating in front of the central sulcus (aka the precentral gyrus, or now known as motor cortex). In the 30s, Penfield and Boldrey showed that stimulation causes contralateral movement: that is, stimulating the left side of the brain affects the right side of the body. We now know this is because most pathways cross over to the other side of the body (usually at the spinal cord or the brainstem). As techniques became more refined, a clearer map evolved. Initially it was presumed to be similar to the somatosensory homunculus (that might be anachronistc!) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Sensory_Homunculus.png/330px-Sensory_Homunculus.png" alt="homunculus" width=300/>. Recent findings show that motor cortex is not as neatly organized as other "primary" areas like V1 and S1. Instead, limb representations are largely overlapping, but instead with general trends, as shown by Park & Cheney's "horshoe" map (P&C 2001, Fig3). 

These mappings (along with high density electrod arrays, robotics, and decoders like Kalman filters) led to a spur in development of motor prothestics, in which hundreds of electrodes were implanted, the neural activity decoded and used to control a cursor on a screen or a robotic limb. In many of these experiments, the "information" each site was believed to contain was rather simple: move the cursor up, or move the arm to the left, etc. Researchers tried to differentiate between position or velocity encoding to figure out how the brain controls movement, or were more agnostic and instead were focused on improving movement control for amputees and spinal cord injuries. 

In the early 2000s, there was a radical new idea: instead of using very brief electrical stimulation to trigger minute twitches, Graziano instead used long stimulation trains, similar in duration to movements (approx half a second or longer) (Graziano Moor 2002, Fig2). They showed that from a single position in the brain, they could drive the hand to the same final posture from any starting position! They believed that if your hand was resting on your knee, or on a table in front of you, or reaching out to the side, the same small parcel of brain could be responsible for bringing your hand to your mouth. Further experiments explored more broadly in motor areas, expanded the concept more generally to a gestural/postural map, and then to complex behaviors such as reaching to grasping, climbing, and defense postures. <img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364661315002740-gr1.jpg" alt="behavior_map" width = 600/>

More recently, motor decoding has focused on encoding complex trajectories from ensembles of neurons.

This kind of mapping procedure can also be used clinically. In some cases of medication-resistant epliepsy, neurosurgeons may elect to remove an affected area of the brain. If an EEG or fMRI study suggests that parts of motor cotex are involved (as in sensory mapping), neurosurgeons can electrically stimulate portions of the motor cortex to determine the origin of the seizures, or to ensure that they do not remove areas critical to speech and hand movement so that the patient will not have major impairments following the procedure. This is also done in neuro-oncology to reduce the loss of critical motor function and overall morbidity.

### Descending Signals - Christopher Reeve

Prefrontal/SMA - premotor - motor
Most of the prefrontal cortex is involved in motor control. In many mammals, motor cortex takes up most of the real estate in front of the central sulcus. In primates and humans more cortical areas have involved which allow for finer control of movements, more complicated movements, and longer term movement planning.

The key motor cortical areas are primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PM), and the supplementary motor area (SMA), but there are others like the frontal eye field (EFE), for example.

Within the motor cortex, different muscle groups are laid out in a rough topography. This means that neurons that control the thumb are near other neurons that control the thumb, and also near neurons that control the index finger. This representation is called the "motor homunculus," in which body parts with larger representations in the brain are shown with larger size. Homunculus is Latin for “little man,” implying that there is a representation of a little man lying across motor cortex. While this isn’t completely true, it is a good way to think about the organization of motor cortex.

The output neurons of motor cortex send their axons down into the brainstem and spinal cord through the cortico-bulbar and -spinal tracts (“cortex to bulb” with bulb meaning brainstem or “cortex to spinal” tract, sometimes anatomical names aren’t so confusing!). It is also called the pyramidal tract as it travels through a structure at the base of the medulla called the pyramid.

Primary motor cortex is one of several upper motor control centers. It is the control center required for deliberate, volitional movements, movements made in response to a “command.” Furthermore, motor cortex cells can contract motoneurons directly (motor cortex cells also reach motoneurons indirectly through intervening neurons) and have a huge influence on motoneuron firing. Essentially, when a motor cortex cell fires, the motoneuron that it contacts is also highly likely to fire. This connection is so strong that some call the motor cortex cell, an “upper motor neuron.” In this terminology, the motoneuron is the “lower motor neuron” which fires whenever the upper motor neuron says jump.

SMA

Premotor

Here's another controversial topic in the motor system: mirror neurons. These were discovered by some Italian neurodudes (Rizzolatti et al) in a part of premotor cortex (PMv). These neurons were active both during a movement, and when the same movement was observed in another (animal or person). Some believe these neurons are involved in learning behaviors and understanding the behaviors of others, although this is speculation. Given the complexity of the task of understanding the behavior of others, it is unlikely to be encded at the level of individual neurons (Churchland). 

Brain Stem
The brainstem is an important part of the motor system. It contains motoneurons that allow us to move our eyes, make facial expressions, chew, swallow and speak. It also contains upper motor control centers such as the red nucleus, superior colliculus, and horizontal gaze center.

Spinal cord - muscles
Corticospinal cells send motor “command” information into the spinal cord through their axons. These neurons synapse onto motoneurons which send axons out of the central nervous system to innervate skeletal muscles. Motoneurons synapse onto muscles at a special synapse called the “neuromuscular junction” or “endplate.”

Cerebellum (this part has been written already)

Basal Ganglia

### Sensory Feedback
When we think of muscles, we think of movement. That makes sense: muscles make us move. But an important side of movement is sensation, in particular somatosensation (sensing or perceiving the body). One side of somatosensation is called proprioception, which is the sensation of our body in the world. For example, if you close your eyes, you can still feel your posture and know how you are sitting. You can even reach out and grab things, fairly accurately, with your eyes closed. In order to make an accurate movement, it’s important to know where your starting position. It’s also important to know how well the actual movement matches the intended movement. If you are making an error, the sooner you discover it the sooner you can update your movement plan and adjust the movement.

This is what proprioception does for us: it tells us where we are and where we are going (it works closely with the vestibular system to accomplish this).

Receptors in our muscles, tendons, joints, and skin detect contraction, stretch, and vibration. Sensory neurons carrying this information synapse onto neurons in the spinal cord, sending sensory information to motoneurons and also up to the forebrain. Sensory information is used to update the movements and correct movements that go awry.

Additionally, motor cortex and somatosensory cortex are densely interconnected, which allows direct commnication about the current state of the body (proprioception in S1), the movement plan (informing the sensory system of an upcoming movement so it can anticipate and correct for the movements), and the results of the movement (error feedback).
