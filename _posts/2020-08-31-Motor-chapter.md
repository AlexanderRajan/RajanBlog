# 10. Motor system

## Overview

The motor system is how we control our body. It is involved in planning and executing movements, but also in pumping blood and digesting food. The two key roles of the motor system is to plan, control, and execute voluntary (deliberate) movements, and to control involuntary (subconscious or automatic) functions.

In a voluntary movement, neural activity in the frontal lobe sends commands down to motoneurons located in the brainstem or spinal cord, which in turn project on to muscles. Motoneurons are the only neurons that innervate skeletal muscles. When and only when a motoneuron fires does a skeletal muscle contract.

In the motor hierarchy information flows down from the brain to muscles far more than it flows back up. The brain is the boss and muscles are the workers. That said, there is some information flow upwards as information from sensory receptors in the muscles and skin is fed back into the system, reaching both motoneurons and also (eventually) forebrain motor control centers.

This chapter we will cover:
* Muscles
  * Muscle types
  * Components of muscles
  * Motor unites
  * Muscle functions
* Neuromuscular junction - control of muscles
* Spinal cord - reflexes
* Motor cortex - motor control
* Motor modifiers - cerebellum & basal ganglia
* Sensory feedback - proprioception & somatosensory cortex
* Movement disorders
  * Parkinson's disease
  * Ataxia
  * Dystonia
  * Huntington's disease
  * Rare diseases? PKAN, beriberi

  

As mentioned above, there are both voluntary and involuntary motor functions. Usually people think of deliberate movements and the voluntary skeletal muscles when thinking about the motor system. Here we'll describe skeletal muscle in the most detail, as they are the most studied, and provide information along the way about how cardiac and smooth muscle are different.

## Muscles

You can't move without muscles, so we'll start there!

The main thing that muscles do is contract, and they tend to get wider as they get shorter. As you flex your arm starting from fully extended, your bicep changes from long and thin to short and thick. Different muscles have different characteristics driven by their shape and composition. For example, some muscles can be active for a long time without getting tired (maintaining your posture in your chair as you read this) while others can exert a lot of force but get tired quickly (lifting weights in the gym).

When people study muscles, some of the key measurements are where they connect to the bone, how long they are, how thick they are, and what type of muscle fibers they are made of. These measurements can be used to calculate how much force a muscle can generate and how quickly the joint can move.

### Muscle components - fasciles, fibers, and sarcomeres

Individual muscles, such as your biceps brachii, are made up of several muscle fascicles, which in turn are made up of muscle fibers. Muscle fibers are the individual cells in which contraction occurs. The functional units for contraction are called sarcomeres. Here's where smallest unit of movement happens! It is the aggregated activity of hundreds of thousands of sarcomeres within each muscle fiber that generates the force with which you walk your dog, chew your food, and even what beats your heart.

   The smallest functional unit of muscles are sarcomeres.

   ![sarcomere image](http://www.pradeepluther.com/pklwork19may02/images/frog-ls-f27175.jpg "Sarcomere image")
   
   The (contr)action within sarcomeres happens between actin and myosin. Actin are thin filaments that form the scaffolding, and myosin are thick filaments that pull the actin together, shortening the sarcomere and contracting the muscle. Although each sarcomere is small (1.5 to 3.5 µm), many are stacked back to back along the length of each fiber, pulling against each other to contract through the whole range of your joints. Many sarcomeres (and fibers and fasciles) bundled in parallel provide the combined force that give muscles strength.   


### Muscle types
There are two key characteristics of muscles: their structure (striated or smooth), and whether they can be voluntarily controlled. Based on these characteristics, there are three types of muscles in vertebrates (and humans).

|   | Striated | Smooth |
|---|---|---|
| **Voluntary** | Skeletal muscle |   |
| **Involuntary** | Cardiac muscle | Smooth muscle |

* Skeletal muscle

   These are what most people think of when they think “muscle.” They attach to bones with tendons, and exert force on your skeleton to create movement and exert force on objects.
   
   !(bone tendon muscle)[https://training.seer.cancer.gov/images/anatomy/muscular/muscle_structure.jpg "Bone, tendon, muscle"]
   Muscles are connected to your bones via tendons. While you can train and grow muscles with exercise, your tendons and bones pretty much stay the same. Make sure you don't overwork your tendons! They don't recover as quickly as muscle.
   
   Skeletal muscles are also called "voluntary muscles" because they are the muscles that move when you choose to make a movement. They are voluntarily contracted (and in reflexes) to move your body by moving your skeleton.  
   
   
   
   
   There are two types of skeletal muscles: fast twitch and slow twitch fibers. 
   
   * Fast twitch muscles generate a lot of force quickly, but also tire quickly. They are used mostly in high intensity exercise like lifting weights and sprinting.  
   * Slow twitch muscles generate less force, but can work for a long time. They are used in endurance exercise like jogging.
   (Many exercises use a mix of both).
   
   Muscles come in several different shapes, defined by the arrangement of their fibers and how they connect to tendons.
   
   ![muscle shapes](https://www.teachpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shapes-muscle595.jpg "Shapes of skeletal muscles")
   
   * Most striated muscles are parallel, where all of the cells that exert force work in the same direction. This leads to the largest change in length.
   * Some muscles are pennate, or feather shaped. These muscles can generate more force, but change length less and are slower. ![pennate muscle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Pennation_angle_of_fibers_in_pennate_muscle.png/330px-Pennation_angle_of_fibers_in_pennate_muscle.png "Pennate muscle")
   * Hydrostats, unlike other skeletal muscles, move themselves instead of bones. Think of your tongue, or an elephant's trunk, which can grasp objects, push food around, and change shape to create different sounds during talking.
   

* Cardiac muscle

   Can be thought of as a hybrid between skeletal muscles and smooth muscles, in that they are structured like skeletal muscles (striated muscles) but not under conscious control. 
   
* Smooth muscle

   These are the muscles embedded within organs like your stomach and intestines, blood vessels, and baldder. 
   They are also known as "involuntary" muscles because they are not under direct conscious control. 

### Motor units & motor pools
Groups of organized muscles
Motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates
Groups of motor unites work together to coordinate contractions within a single muscle
A motor pool is all of the individual neurons that innervate a single muscle


### Muscle functions
Muscles contract
    Leads to changes in shape - usually shortening, but sometimes not!
    Strength vs speed (form and function)

Muscles in cooperation and opposition
Agonists, synergists, fixators, and antagonists
![synergy](https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/wp-content/uploads/sites/142/2016/03/1101_Biceps_Muscle.jpg "Muscles coordinate")
The agonist is the main mover, like the biceps brachii when you flex your elbow. It's movement is supported by synergistic muscles, including the brachialis and brachioradialis. These can also be fixators, providing stability and preventing or allowing rotation of the wrist while flexing at the elbow. Antagonist muscles are those that move in the opposite direction to the agonist. For the elbow, this is the triceps bracii, which is how you extend your elbow. Another example of an agonist-antagonist pair are the hamstrings to flex the leg, and the gradriceps to extend it.

Muscles tend to be proximal to the joint that they move. Your pectoralis muscles are proximal to your shoulder, and your biceps brachii are prixmal to your elbow. When splinting a bone, you want to secure the joints on both sides of the bone; when splinting a joint, you want to secure the bones on both sides of the joint.

Dynamic stretching increases bloodflow to muscles and tendons and is a good way to prevent injuries by stretching before exercise. However, stretching can't prevent overuse injuries or damage to tendons. Passive stretching (after exercise) can be useful to decrease muscle soreness.
