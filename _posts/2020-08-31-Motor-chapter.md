# 10. Motor system

## Overview

The motor system is how we control our body. It is involved in planning and executing movements, but also in pumping blood and digesting food. The two key roles of the motor system is to plan, control, and execute voluntary (deliberate) movements, and to control involuntary (subconscious or automatic) functions.

In a voluntary movement, neural activity in the frontal lobe sends commands down to motoneurons located in the brainstem or spinal cord, which in turn project on to muscles. Motoneurons are the only neurons that innervate skeletal muscles. When and only when a motoneuron fires does a skeletal muscle contract.

In the motor hierarchy information flows down from the brain to muscles far more than it flows back up. The brain is the boss and muscles are the workers. That said, there is some information flow upwards as information from sensory receptors in the muscles and skin is fed back into the system, reaching both motoneurons and also (eventually) forebrain motor control centers.

This chapter will be organized as follows:
* Muscles
  * Muscle types
  * Components of muscles
  * Motor unites
  * Muscle functions
* Neuromuscular junction - control of muscles
* Spinal cord - reflexes
* Motor cortex - motor control
* Motor modifiers - cerebellum & basal ganglia
* Sensory feedback - proprioception & somatosensory cortex
* Movement disorders
  * Parkinson's disease
  * Ataxia
  * Dystonia
  * Huntington's disease
  * Rare diseases? PKAN, beriberi

  

As mentioned above, there are both voluntary and involuntary motor functions. Usually people think of deliberate movements and the voluntary skeletal muscles when thinking about the motor system. Here we'll describe skeletal muscle in the most detail, as they are the most studied, and provide information about how cardiac and smooth muscle are different.

## Muscles
Muscles cause all movement, so we'll start there too.

Change in length vs generation of force. The main thing that muscles do is contract, and they tend to get wider as they get shorter. As you flex your arm starting from fully extended, your bicep changes from long and thin to short and thick. Since muscles move different joints and have different bodily functions, they have different structures. 

### Muscle components

* Muscle fibers
   
   The smallest functional unit of muscles are sarcomeres. 
   All muscles are made up of muscle fibers. They are the

### Muscle types
There are two key characteristics of muscles: their structure (striated or smooth), and whether they can be voluntarily controlled. Based on these characteristics, there are three types of muscles in vertebrates (and humans).

|   | Striated | Smooth |
|---|---|---|
| **Voluntary** | Skeletal muscle |   |
| **Involuntary** | Cardiac muscle | Smooth muscle |

* Skeletal muscle

   These are what most people think of when they think “muscle.”
   AKA "voluntary muscle" because they are the muscles that move when you choose to make a movement. They are voluntarily contracted (and in reflexes) to move your body by moving your skeleton.  
   There are two types of skeletal muscles: fast twitch and slow twitch fibers. 
   
   * Fast twitch muscles generate a lot of force quickly, but also tire quickly. They are used mostly in high intensity exercise like lifting weights and sprinting.  
   * Slow twitch muscles generate less force, but can work for a long time. They are used in endurance exercise like jogging.
   (Many exercises use a mix of both).
   
   Muscles come in several different shapes, defined by the arrangement of their fibers and how they connect to tendons.
   
   ![muscle shapes](https://www.teachpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shapes-muscle595.jpg Shapes of skeletal muscles)
   
   * Most striated muscles are parallel, where all of the cells that exert force work in the same direction. This leads to the largest change in length.
   * Some muscles are pennate, or feather shaped. These muscles can generate more force, but change length less and are slower. ![pennate muscle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Pennation_angle_of_fibers_in_pennate_muscle.png/330px-Pennation_angle_of_fibers_in_pennate_muscle.png "Pennate muscle")

* Cardiac muscle

   Can be thought of as a hybrid between skeletal muscles and smooth muscles, in that they are structured like skeletal muscles (striated muscles) but not under conscious control. 
   
* Smooth muscle

   These are the muscles embedded within organs like your stomach and intestines, blood vessels, and baldder. 
   They are also known as "involuntary" muscles because they are not under direct conscious control.

### Muscle functions
Muscles contract
    Leads to changes in shape - usually shortening, but sometimes not!
    Strength vs speed (form and function)

Muscles in opposition

Control of digestion, bladder, blood vessels, etc

What triggers the muscles? Neurons!
